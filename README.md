# MLB Hit and HR Predictor

This project predicts MLB players chances of getting a hit and homerun using Statcast data. 
The project will display the top 5 players probable of getting a hit and top 3 players of getting a Home Run for each game using a GUI built with Streamlit. 
The user will be able to choose between a game or player they decide. This will also include the opportunity to see all probabilities from each game. 

The project uses a machine learning model that incorporates the opposite facing pitcher stats, the stadium they are playing in and of course, the players stats. 


## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the daily predictor:
```bash
python main.py
```
