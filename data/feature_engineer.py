Feature Engineering Module for MLB Hit and HR Prediction

This module creates advanced sabermetric features specifically designed for:
1. Hit Prediction: Contact-based metrics, BABIP factors, plate discipline
2. HR Prediction: Power metrics, launch conditions, ballpark adjustments

Key Sabermetric Features Explained:
- wOBA: Weighted On-Base Average (weights hits by their run value)
- xwOBA: Expected wOBA based on quality of contact
- ISO: Isolated Power (SLG - AVG, measures extra-base hit ability)
- Barrel%: Rate of "barreled" balls (optimal exit velo + launch angle)
- Hard Hit%: Rate of balls hit 95+ mph
- Whiff%: Miss rate on swings (predictor of contact ability)
- Chase%: Rate of swinging at balls outside strike zone
